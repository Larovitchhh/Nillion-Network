About Nillion
Nillion is a pioneering secure computation network that leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), to enable "blind computing." Unlike traditional systems where data must be decrypted to be processed, Nillion allows encrypted data to remain private while still being computed upon. This decentralizes trust in a manner akin to how blockchains decentralize transactions, opening up new possibilities for privacy-preserving applications.
The Nillion Network aims to empower developers to build applications where sensitive data—be it financial records, personal information, or intellectual property—can be utilized without compromising security or privacy.
Features
Blind Compute: Process encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

Decentralized Trust: Eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries to manage sensitive data.

Scalable Storage: Securely store and retrieve data across the network.

Developer-Friendly SDK: Tools and libraries (e.g., Python-based SDK) to integrate Nillion into your projects.

Incentivized Testnet: Participate in testing and earn potential rewards (as of the ongoing testnet phase).

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and explore the Nillion Network on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Required for running the Nillion SDK.

Git: To clone this repository.

Pip: Python package manager for installing dependencies.

Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Installation
Clone the Repository
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/nillion-network-repo.git
cd nillion-network-repo

Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: If you're starting fresh, create a requirements.txt with nillion-sdk or other dependencies as needed.

Download the Nillion SDK
Refer to the official Nillion Python Quickstart for the latest SDK setup instructions.

Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use the Nillion SDK to store and retrieve data securely:
python

from nillion import Client, StoreRequest

# Initialize the Nillion client
client = Client("your-node-endpoint")

# Example: Store encrypted data
data = "Hello, Nillion!"
request = StoreRequest(data.encode(), ttl=3600)  # TTL in seconds
store_id = client.store(request)
print(f"Data stored with ID: {store_id}")

# Example: Retrieve the data
retrieved_data = client.retrieve(store_id)
print(f"Retrieved data: {retrieved_data.decode()}")

For more advanced use cases, such as blind computation or integrating with the testnet, check the examples/ directory in this repository or the official Nillion documentation.
